# Supersaas.dev NuxtHub

This version of supersaas.dev is built specifically for [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com/). 

Why a separate repo?

1. Easier to get started
2. Less friction
3. Smaller bundle size
4. Removes Unnecessary code

You can read more on how to deploy this on our docs [here](https://supersaas.dev/docs/nuxthub)
